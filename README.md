# CGPA-Calculator-
A simple small app that gets data from the user on their classes and provides the GPA per semester or CGPA.

The goal with this program is to practice some basics with C++ such as data structures, file handling (I/O streams), and doing basic math.
At the moment the user only interacts with the program through the terminal, but loking to in the future create a GUI to make the program more pleasing and easier to use.
Please ignore the messy code and some questionable uses of the hashmap as i'm more familar with Python and although I used C++ during my time in college. Just a short time of not using it has caused me to forget some things so i'm practicing using C++ again with going back to the basics while trying new methods that better meet industry standards.

Goals with this project.
